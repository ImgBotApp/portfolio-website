 <div class="about-think grid-33">
    <h2>I like to think outside the box.</h2>
    <p>I am relentless in my pursuit to find clean, intuitive solutions to solve everyday problems. I love designing things that clients will love and want to show off. I dig deep until I understand exactly what people want to see even if it seems impossible. Incredible experiences are what I am after.</p>

    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I have a degree in Finance from the University of Florida (I love math) and have since worked in several positions where I have been able to expand my love of technology and share it with others. When I am not glued to a MacBook screen, I like to wakeboard, mountain bike, travel and watch college football.</p>

  <div class="about-passion grid-33">
    <h2>Being passionate is my game.</h2>
    <p>I love web design and I want my clients to love their websites and apps just as much as I do. Itâ€™s one thing to be hardworking but passion is what makes the difference between something great and something amazing. </p>
