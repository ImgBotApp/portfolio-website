challenge: The GradeCraft student homepage was utilizing <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html" target="_blank">timeline.js</a> which we were learning was slightly confusing to students in gameful courses where many assignments and events could be occurring on the same day, thus cluttering the timeline and making it hard to see what was important. With an eye towards making the interface more modern and highlighting the information we have available to students, I thought a dashboard design was the best approach. 

process: I reviewed materials gathered in the most recent round of usability testing and determined that students were looking for an easier way to quickly see how they are doing and a better way to visualize and track what was due in their course. I reviewed many other dashboards (the most motivating for me are FitBit and Nike+ apps for iPhone) and decided that small but meaningful snippets of information are often the most motivating and engaging. Information that was currently being captured and presented back to students via a right sidebar was a box plot for the class, their current level and number of total points, badges earned and a list of assignments that were due in the next seven days. I decided that the removal of the sidebar would allow for better use of the screen real estate and that the stats shown there could easily be shown on the dashboard instead. 

solution: After discussing a finalized list of design requirements with my team, my intern and I did a round of rough sketching to bring the concept to life. We settled on a to-do list that would show students assignments coming up by due date for the whole course that could be toggled to show assignments they had chosen to complete. Phase two of this design will include support for students assigning their own due dates to assignments so they can better navigate their busy schedules. When I was able to dig into the code to make the changes, I started with a restyling of the old sidebar partials. I rendered these on a dashboard and used Flexbox to create the columnar layout I wanted. I also updated the info visuals to use D3.js and was able to deprecate the timeline.js plugin in favor of a simple slider module that simply held course events.
