#content
challenge: 5 out of 5 students mentioned the assignment page as a source of confusion in our Fall 2016 usability testing. The accordion design on the assignment page was leaving students unable to easily find information about which assignments were available for completion and which had already received grades, not to mention which assignments were required or predicted. We needed a way to extend some of the styling on the ‘Assignments Due this Week’ module on the dashboard since students were finding much more value in the way this information was presented.

process: I knew we needed to alter the visual hierarchy on the page since most students were missing the additional sections when one of the accordions was open due to current styling. We also needed a way to visually distinguish predicted, required and completed assignments in a way that was consistent with the dashboard module. In most instances when improving existing design, I believe strongly in applying the Pareto Principle to UX design as mentioned in <a href='http://blog.invisionapp.com/pareto-principle-based-user-research/' target='_blank'>this article</a>. If we believe that 20% of an application can be improved to address 80% of our users’ difficulties, we can really start to pack a punch with design. I headed to Sketch to mockup a page (and mobile screens) I would want to interact with if I were a student and ended up with styling very similar to Inbox by Google. 


solution: I wanted to get away from the use of HTML tables altogether on the student side after hearing what these sounded like on a screen reader, so I implemented my mockup with divs for each assignment and assignment type container instead of table rows. I added a graphical representation of the points earned in each category and a light grey background behind the assignments when the accordions were open to make the design feel more cohesive. I used flag icons to represent predicted assignments like I use in the dashboard module so students would realize which assignments they had planned to complete and styled graded assignments with a green checkmark. Tearing out the tables made a huge improvement on the mobile experience and made the sections easily scannable and much more parsable to students.
