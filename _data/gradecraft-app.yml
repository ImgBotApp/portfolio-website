biggest_challenge: The biggest challenge I have faced on GradeCraft has been working on a project of this size. The codebase has been in development for nearly five years and is the collective effort of many different developers. As the lead front-end developer on the project, I am responsible for the user experience and accessibility of the app, and am constantly trying to think of new ways to streamline styles and components for ease of maintenance by the rest of my team.

best_thing_i_learned: "Working on GradeCraft has been one of the biggest learning experiences of my career so far. The tech stack alone lent itself to gaining exposure to a multitude of languages (Ruby on Rails, Angular, jQuery, Haml) and working in a team taught me a lot about Git and how to most efficiently contribute to large codebase. Some of my largest contributions to this project include: dashboards for students and instructors, refactored analytics with plotly.js, mobile menus, more extensible sass architecture and style guidelines, accessibility and responsive design updates, and user experience updates based on many rounds of user testing."

up_next: Since GradeCraft is now publicly available, we are working to eliminate any user experience confusion as well as streamline the onboarding process for new instructors and students as we receive feedback from a much larger user community.


challenge: GradeCraft is a learning management system designed to support gameful courses that is being developed at the University of Michigan. When I started working with this team, I was thrilled to be tasked with redesigning the public facing website to support the goal of eventually selling the app outside U-M. The website needed a facelift to match the playfulness and style of app itself and also to communicate the goals of gameful learning and GradeCraft as a way to facilitate gameful learning and teaching.

process: After brainstorming necessary pieces of information to include with the lead developer, I considered the intended audience for this site. Although students and instructors who were using GradeCraft on a daily basis at U-M would certainly see the refreshed site before logging in, our target audience was really instructors in both K-12 and higher education who were interested in incorporating elements of good games in their course design. I also thought about what our pricing model might look like and who the decision makers in that process would be to make sure our message was clear and direct no matter who was reviewing the information. With my list of necessary content, I sketched out possible layouts on whiteboards and paper before mocking up the page in Sketch. Putting tangible examples in front of stakeholders and users as soon as possible was extremely helpful in soliciting tangible feedback which I used to refine the designs further before handing off fully annotated documents to the developers.

solution: When considering the purchase or use of a web application, I like to see as much about the interface as possible before having to create an account. With that in mind, I knew that screenshots of the application weren’t going to be the most visually appealing and loved the thought of having a minimalistic but playful take on the different components of this gameful LMS. To achieve this, I created graphics that represented each of the different available features and made sure to give succinct descriptions of the building blocks of gameful. I kept the color pallette inline with the application’s style guide and highlighted the signature background scene by showing it through the hero section and footer.
