name: GradeCraft Poster
role: 
  - Visual Design
  - Print Design
overview: The GradeCraft team won a <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/06/01/press-release-campus-technology-announces-2016-innovators-award-honorees.aspx" target="_blank">Campus Technology Award</a> and I made a poster to take to the ceremony. We wanted it to give a good overview of the main points of gameful pedagogy and some highlights of the project so far as well as describe the features of the application. I made the graphics in Sketch and assembled the 3' x 4' poster in Photoshop.
