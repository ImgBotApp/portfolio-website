biggest_challenge: One of my first projects with the GradeCraft team was to redesign the public facing website. This was challenging because GradeCraft is a very unique concept that exists in a somewhat cluttered namespace of similar game-related educational projects. It was difficult to decide how exactly to frame our product in a way that was succinct and impactful while maintaining a playful visual style that best reflected GradeCraft. To achieve this, I created graphics that represented each of the different available features and made sure to give brief descriptions of the building blocks of gameful course design.

best_thing_i_learned: Redesigning the public website was a good way to get familiar with Haml templating and allowed me to learn the importance of presenting a clear message about what your product is and how it will serve its intended audience. Thinking through the content for a homepage is a great way to answer these fundamental questions about what the priorities of a project should be.

up_next: Next up for the public site will be to optimize performance and find places to create delightful experiences for those interacting for the first time and for returning users logging in.

challenge: GradeCraft is a learning management system designed to support gameful courses that is being developed at the University of Michigan. When I started working with this team, I was thrilled to be tasked with redesigning the public facing website to support the goal of eventually selling the app outside U-M. The website needed a facelift to match the playfulness and style of app itself and also to communicate the goals of gameful learning and GradeCraft as a way to facilitate gameful learning and teaching.

process: After brainstorming necessary pieces of information to include with the lead developer, I considered the intended audience for this site. Although students and instructors who were using GradeCraft on a daily basis at U-M would certainly see the refreshed site before logging in, our target audience was really instructors in both K-12 and higher education who were interested in incorporating elements of good games in their course design. I also thought about what our pricing model might look like and who the decision makers in that process would be to make sure our message was clear and direct no matter who was reviewing the information. With my list of necessary content, I sketched out possible layouts on whiteboards and paper before mocking up the page in Sketch. Putting tangible examples in front of stakeholders and users as soon as possible was extremely helpful in soliciting tangible feedback which I used to refine the designs further before handing off fully annotated documents to the developers.

solution: When considering the purchase or use of a web application, I like to see as much about the interface as possible before having to create an account. With that in mind, I knew that screenshots of the application weren’t going to be the most visually appealing and loved the thought of having a minimalistic but playful take on the different components of this gameful LMS. To achieve this, I created graphics that represented each of the different available features and made sure to give succinct descriptions of the building blocks of gameful. I kept the color pallette inline with the application’s style guide and highlighted the signature background scene by showing it through the hero section and footer.
