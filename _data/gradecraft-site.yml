#content
biggest_challenge: One of my first projects with the GradeCraft team was to redesign the public facing website. This was challenging because GradeCraft is a very unique concept that exists in a somewhat cluttered namespace of similar game-related educational projects. It was difficult to decide how exactly to frame our product in a way that was succinct and impactful while maintaining a playful visual style that best reflected GradeCraft. To achieve this, I created graphics that represented each of the different available features and made sure to give brief descriptions of the building blocks of gameful course design.

best_thing_i_learned: Redesigning the public website was a good way to get familiar with Haml templating and allowed me to learn the importance of presenting a clear message about what your product is and how it will serve its intended audience. Thinking through the content for a homepage is a great way to answer these fundamental questions about what the priorities of a project should be.

up_next: Next up for the public site will be to optimize performance and find places to create delightful experiences for those interacting for the first time and for returning users logging in.

challenge: GradeCraft's public site needed a facelift to match the playfulness and style of app itself and also to communicate the goals of gameful learning.

process: Define the target audience for the application and understand more abotu who the decision makers would be. Allow the existing playful style of the application to shine through in the public site while highlighting unique features.

solution: A modern website that matched the signature style of GradeCraft while maintaining an air of professionalism and credibility.
