      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Patrick proposed to me in February of 2014. In an effort to get a wedding planned and executed by fall of that year (fall and winter is really the only time to have a wedding in Florida without sweating), we had to throw convention out the window and handle the passage of information and RSVPs with a website, of course.</p>

    <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>We had seen several wedding websites and really liked the idea of telling the story of us in the best medium we know. This made it really easy to communicate all the necessary information about the wedding venue to our guests who were mostly coming from out of town.</p>

    <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>The RSVP function made it effortless to collect the list of people who would be attending and plan accordingly. Pat wrote a program to email us every time the form was filled out. We also assigned a code to all our invites so when our friends and family came to the website, they entered the code and we knew who was attending. </p>
