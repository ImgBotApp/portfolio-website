      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>The Michigan Athletic Department had an extremely antiquated intranet that almost no one used and rarely got updated. With over 300 people on staff that needed to access documents and information, they needed a change. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>I designed and built the intranet using Google Sites. The University had recently transitioned to Google, so it was the best way to use the technology we had and get our employees familiar with Google products at the same time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>With highlights such as a searchable directory and RSS feed of sports scores that updated as games finished, the intranet was used by almost every employee on a daily basis and sparked the beginning of the process automation boom within the department.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The Human Resources team at UM Athletics was interviewing on average, twice as many people as they needed to for each position. They did not have a screening process in place to filter out those applicants who were not qualified for a position.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Since we had recently made the transition from Microsoft Exchange to Google, I developed a form using HTML inside a Google Site and used Google App Script to write a program to email the PDF application upon submission.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>The HR team would send the link to this form out to anyone who had applied through the University's job board. I then created a folder inside the Gmail of each of the 3 HR team members that collected these applicant forms so they were able to sift through and find candidates that looked promising.</p>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>There was no good way for student-athletes to reserve study rooms at the academic center. During popular times of the week, the facility would be so crowded that student-athletes would regret coming by. </p>
     </div>
     <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>I wanted to use Google calendars since all student-athletes had a Google account for their University email. I then created a site for the Ross Academic Center and placed a map of study rooms with a clickable map that lead students to the calendar for that room in order to reserve.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>Student-athletes were able to control the traffic at the building by reserving time slots ahead of time to use rooms. This way, no one had to end up with no table or room to work in.</p>
