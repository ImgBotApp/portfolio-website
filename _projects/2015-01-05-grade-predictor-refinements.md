      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>I read a great article recently about how when simplicity is unrealistic due to large amounts of information that need to be shown, clarity should be the goal. The grade predictor is a tool within GradeCraft that allows students to predict how well they will do in their course by selecting and predicting how well they will do on available assignments. It is one of the most visited pages in the application because the data is so valuable to students, but in usability testing, we were learning that some students found this page to be so overwhelming they avoided it at all costs. The other issue that was uncovered during testing was the cumbersome workflow for students to actually choose assignments they were interested in and then predicting those grades. Full assignment descriptions lived in a different page of the site, so students were usually flipping between pages to read and predict, making the situation even more complicated.</p>


      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>After asking a series of questions to find out what exactly was making students feel overwhelmed, I got some tangible design requirements for this issue - (1) too many colors were being used, (2) too many icons were shown, (3) too many assignments were available in categories with max point values or max quantities. This was a textbook example of a content-heavy page with many possible interactions and workflows. Clarity became my goal - students needed to be able to easily see the necessary information about their assignments in order to make informed predictions of their grades. I listed all the colors and icons on the whiteboard with my colleague, Mike Wojan, and began categorizing them into “states” and “characteristics.”</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>We determined that states could easily be represented by color: blue for available, green for graded and gray for no longer available and that characteristics. Since each of these states was also distinguishable by changed content on the card face itself, color was not the only indicator and thus more accessible. We also took the list of 10+ icons that were used to communicate assignment characteristics and ranked them in order of importance in terms of choosing an assignment. We decided the three at the top of our list (late, required and locked) were the most likely to affect a student’s decision to choose to complete an assignment, so we kept those on the face of the card and moved the rest to the sidebar where assignment information would be displayed. In addition to the reduction of colors and icons, the new page design included a right sidebar that would offer a more robust description than was available in the tooltip that showed on hover as well as the less important characteristics.</p>
