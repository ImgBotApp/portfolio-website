      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>With the help of a full-stack developer, I created a series of tools for the Project Managers of WGI. I knew we needed a simple interface for them to easily access these tools in order for anyone to use them. A splash page that could be deployed to each desktop made the most sense to achieve the participation we were looking for. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>I started with a sketch of the page (and logo) and built the site with the idea in mind that it had to look clean and simple in order for anyone to make this part of their daily routine. As we set up Google accounts for each project manager, this became their new homepage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>Sliding tiles allow access to links to applications created to help project managers track project pursuits and analyze sales data. The page is scalable for growth and more links are added as new tools are built. This has become the new standard for project tracking and is expanding rapidly with new ideas.</p>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>This project replaced a paper form that had been used to to transmit project info throughout the state. The process was confusing ("I need how many pages?") and cumbersome and had billable project managers spending a lot more administrative time than necessary. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>I designed the process and workflow from start to finish and completed both a beta test and slow roll out until the form was live and functioning companywide. The beta test group had a lot of suggestions to offer with usability and their input was invaluable for getting the form used by all.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>The form is now accessible by all through the company intranet and used by 100%. Emails are automatically sent to selected approvers and then on to the final recipient in accounting while information is stored in a database. Contracts that used to sit in filing cabinets are now paperlessly uploaded, filed and accessible anywhere.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>With a company of 230+ employees and 10 different divisions all managing lists of project pursuits, a whiteboard or a spreadsheet just doesnâ€™t cut it when trying to get an accurate picture of how busy we are and what resources we need for our workload.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>I knew we needed to utilize some collaborative technology in order to keep up with the volume of projects and ever-changing timelines. A link behind the Opportunities tile on their splash page allows project managers to update a Google Sheet that keeps the data on the visualizer current. (the visualizer was brought to life by <a href="http://patrick.hoopr.io" target="_blank">Patrick Hooper</a>)</p>
   </div>
   <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>Now everyone from the marketing coordinator to the president can see what is due and when and projects can be added and edited anytime from anywhere. With a simple mouseover of the schedule bars, a tooltip comes up with all the information they need to see.</p>

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>This project came at the resquest of the Transportation Division Manager. She needed a way to keep her engineers updating their project wins and losses so they could keep track of their sales goals throughout the year.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>I first imagined a thermometer type of graphic that is often used in fundraising efforts. The spirit of competition and the satisfaction of seeing the sales approach the goal line was the main focus in order to get the engineers engaged.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>The yearly business plans made in Excel were reimagined and redesigned to be more intuitive. Then, using <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>, we built a site that made sales tracking more interesting. As projects are marked with wins and losses, the bullet graphs update and the spreadsheet keeps track of sales by project manager.</p>
