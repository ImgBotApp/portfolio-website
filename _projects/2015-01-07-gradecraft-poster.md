      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>We determined that states could easily be represented by color: blue for available, green for graded and gray for no longer available and that characteristics. Since each of these states was also distinguishable by changed content on the card face itself, color was not the only indicator and thus more accessible. We also took the list of 10+ icons that were used to communicate assignment characteristics and ranked them in order of importance in terms of choosing an assignment. We decided the three at the top of our list (late, required and locked) were the most likely to affect a studentâ€™s decision to choose to complete an assignment, so we kept those on the face of the card and moved the rest to the sidebar where assignment information would be displayed. In addition to the reduction of colors and icons, the new page design included a right sidebar that would offer a more robust description than was available in the tooltip that showed on hover as well as the less important characteristics.</p>
