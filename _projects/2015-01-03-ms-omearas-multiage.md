      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>With an increasing emphasis on technology in early ages of elementary, Ms. O'Meara was looking for a way to get classroom information and resources to her children and parents. She also wanted a classroom blog to share her ideas with other teachers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study solution grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>I took content from a site Ms. O'Meara began in Weebly and reorganized the information in a way that would be easy for children and parents to use. <a href="http://patrick.hoopr.io" target="_blank">Patrick</a> and I built her a custom site using Wordpress so that she could blog and update content and resources as needed throughout the school year.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study result grid-33 tablet-grid-33 center-align">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>Ms. O'Meara's site has gained a lot of momentum at her school and she has inspired other teachers in Michigan to create websites to share information with their parents and other teachers. Her students benefit from being able to learn their way around the web and their parents can quickly see what's going on in their classroom.</p>
